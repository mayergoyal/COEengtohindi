Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about good behavior. Good behavior means

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,000
being kind, respectful and honest. It means saying please and thank you, listening when

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,680
someone is talking and helping others when they need it. A person with good behavior

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:28,000
is polite, friendly and follows rules. When we behave well, people like to be around us. It helps us make friends and earn respect from teachers, parents and elders. Good behavior

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,880
also makes our school and home peaceful and a happy place.
