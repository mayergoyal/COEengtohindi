[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about good behavior. Good behavior means
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.000]   being kind, respectful and honest. It means saying please and thank you, listening when
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   someone is talking and helping others when they need it. A person with good behavior
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.180]   is polite, friendly and follows rules. When we behave well, people like to be around us.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.000]   It helps us make friends and earn respect from teachers, parents and elders. Good behavior
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.880]   also makes our school and home peaceful and a happy place.
