[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which itself is a branch of artificial intelligence.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Deep learning models are inspired by structure and function of human brains, specifically neural networks.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Made up of layers of nodes, neurons each neuron receive input, process it and passes to the next layer.
