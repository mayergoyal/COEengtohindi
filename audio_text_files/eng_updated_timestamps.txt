[0.00 - 5.74] Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about good behavior. Good behavior means
[5.74 - 11.00] being kind, respectful and honest. It means saying please and thank you, listening when
[11.00 - 15.68] someone is talking and helping others when they need it. A person with good behavior
[15.68 - 28.00] is polite, friendly and follows rules. When we behave well, people like to be around us. It helps us make friends and earn respect from teachers, parents and elders. Good behavior
[28.00 - 31.88] also makes our school and home peaceful and a happy place.
